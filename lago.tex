\abstract{
The LAGO (Latin American Giant Observatory) project, aims at the detection of the
highest energy component of Gamma Ray Bursts. It consists in a wide network of
water Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) located at several sites in eight Latin
American countries. Recently it has been shown that WCDs can be used to study
the solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays and other transient effects, by
measuring the variations of the flux of secondary particles at ground level.
Long-term modulation and transient events can be characterized by using the
LAGO detection network, as it spans over a big area with different sites at
different latitudes, longitudes and geomagnetic rigidity cut-offs. In this work
the Observatory is presented with all its sites, and also the
capabilities to complement measurements of solar activity from ground level are
described.
