LAGO-Venezuela has one operative wcd located in M\'erida City, Universidad de Los Andes (Merida-ULA), one non operative wcd located in Caracas City, Universidad Sim\'on Bolivar, (Caracas-USB), and one planned wcd also in Caracas, Universidad Central de Venezuela, (Caracas-UCV).

Merida-ULA and Caracas-USB have equal electronics: Nexys2 Spartan-3E FPGA Board, LAGO signal Analog-to-digital converter, switched power source and GPS. ULA uses one 5' PMT and USB uses one 9' PMT. 

Caracas-USB recently acquired a new Nexys2 in order to restart his wcd operation. Caracas-UCV has planned to acquire his wcd equipment in the next semester period, until march of 2014.
